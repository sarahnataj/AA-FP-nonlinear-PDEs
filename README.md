Abstract:  We consider Anderson acceleration for  numerical solutions of nonlinear time dependent partial differential equations discretized by space-time spectral methods, where classical fixed-point methods converge slowly or even diverge. Specifically, we apply Anderson acceleration with finite window size w to speed up fixed-point methods in solving nonlinear reaction diffusion, nonlinear Schrodinger and incompressible Navier Stokes equations.
